# YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing

    This project focuses on harvesting data from YouTube and storing it in a data warehouse for further analysis. YouTube is one of the largest video-sharing platforms, generating massive amounts of data every day. Harvesting and analyzing this data can provide valuable insights into user behavior, content trends, and audience preferences.

#  Overview
    The process involves collecting data from YouTube using the YouTube Data API, which provides access to various data points such as video metadata, comments, likes, and views. The harvested data is then transformed and loaded into a data warehouse for storage and analysis.

# Purpose
    The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to effectively harvest, store, and analyze YouTube data using modern data engineering tools and techniques. By following the instructions in this README, you will be able to set up a data pipeline for YouTube data harvesting and warehousing in your own environment.
